The provided code implements a linear regression analysis that I did for the introduction of my fauvorite subject: Evolutionary Algotithms. Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual observed values.

The code performs a linear regression analysis by generating synthetic data, adding noise, calculating errors [1], visualizing the data and errors, and optimizing the linear equation through iterative updates[2]. The ultimate goal is to estimate the coefficients of the linear equation that best describe the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

There are lots of state-of-the-art items in this field because linear regression is one of the most used techniques in a huge variety of areas, so my code is an example of all the work done by thousans of students and professionals in the world

CODE IMPACT

This code is important as it demonstrates the process of linear regression, a fundamental technique in statistical modeling and data analysis. Running this code allows you to understand how to fit a line to observed data, assess the quality of the fit through error analysis, and optimize the coefficients using gradient descent. It provides insights into the relationships between variables and can be used for prediction, forecasting, and making informed decisions based on data.
